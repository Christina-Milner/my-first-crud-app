# Model Show Registration App

I used Node.js and Express to create an app for a miniatures show that would allow for the following:

* Register entrants' info and assign them an incrementing ID number to label their displays with
* Accommodating Adult and Junior participants as well as In Competition (display gets judged) and Not In Competition (display does not get judged, but is still eligible for certain prizes)
* Judging the displays, keeping track of which ones are already judged, and assigning prizes
* Ensuring unique prizes like Best of Show can only be awarded once
* Viewing the prize winners in each category, separated by Adults and Juniors
* Show neat little stats like how many models were entered in total


The final version will include features like authentication to protect participants' personal data.

This prototype is live [here on Render](https://model-show-registration-alpha-prototype.onrender.com/).
